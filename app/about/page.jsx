      <p>The Learn@Code is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has<br/> access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of<br/> those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to<br/> hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.</p>
